# The Paper Step Sequencer

Let's combine computer vision with music. I'm coding this step sequencer to extend the capabilities of my synthesizer. 

1) **Computer Vision**: It must recognize the sequence described by coins placed on the grid.
2) **MIDI**: It must send some commands to the synthesizer. Synchonization will be the challenge, I hope it won't turn to an issue.
3) **Augmented Reality**:  Display usfull information, such as commands feedback, bpm, time cursor etc...

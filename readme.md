# ARSequencer

Let's combine computer vision with music. I'm coding this sequencer to extend the capabilities of my sythesizer. 

1) *Computer Vision*: It must recognize the sequence described by coins placed on the grid.
2) *Midi*: It must send some commands to the synthesizer. I hope we will manage precisely syncronized them.
3) *Augmented Reality*:  It could show the time cursor and BPM. As well as a feedback for every coind detected
